<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Hydrate throughout your day, not just after a workout. Get in the habit of sipping water continuously during the day.</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UESCPih.jpg" />
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">If you start your workout dehydrated, you won't get the maximum out of your workout, as water helps your body to exercise more efficiently. General guidelines are to drink 17 to 20 ounces of water 2 to 3 hours before exercising, another 8 ounces during your warm-up (or 20 to 30 minutes before exercising), 7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes during exercise, and 8 ounces of water within 30 minutes after exercising.</p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Always have a bottle of water nearby when exercising, even at home.</p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 1.1em">Staying hydrated is essential when working out, in order to replace the fluids you lose in perspiration; it also helps you to maintain your energy.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 1.1em">A great time to drink water is during a break in between exercises sets, for example.</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/miIOfM8g.jpg" />
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">To maximize the results of your training, try to eat 2 - 3 hours before you exercise. Whether you're trying to stay in shape or shed a few pounds, it's a good idea to eat within 45 minutes or an hour after your workout.</p>

<h1 style="color: #F66D6A">How to workout at home</h1>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Exercising at home has many benefits: you save travelling time, and you can work out whenever you like. Ideally, your workout regime should be as consistent as possible, so that you take your exercise sessions seriously. Please follow the plan:</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/j7tSv7Yg.jpg" />
<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 1.1em">Select certain days and time for your workout session (i.e. Monday, Wednesday and Friday's at 7:00 a.m.)</li>
    <li style="font-size: 1.1em">Designate the area of your home where you can exercise freely. Be sure you have enough space, with no unstable or fragile objects around.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 1.1em">Stay focused. Don't allow yourself to get lazy just because you are at home.</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7IgI7Xug.jpg" />
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">In our application you should set your week timetable.</p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Try to work out when you are alone at home. You don't want to be interrupted by your family members as they get on with their everyday routine. Young children often like to climb all over adults doing push-ups and sit-ups </p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">If a family member stops by and distracts you, it's easy to let that be an excuse to skip your work or to end your session earlier than planned.</p>

<h1 style="color: #F66D6A">Workouts</h1>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Strength training or cardio? Which is better? Although it's a reassonable question, there is no correct answer. Each type of exercises is different and achieves totally different results. Cardio imporves your cardiovascular fitness and it is the main method of burning fat and losing weight. Strength training builds and strengthens your muscles to make you stronger and improve muscle definition. So whether you exercise for health reasons or just to look good, both types of exercise are important.</p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">There're 3 types of workouts in our application. The Free Training Plan includes only cardio workouts.</p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">Cardio exercise is any exercise that raises your heart rate. And we all know that to keep our muscles in shape we need to move them. This movement makes them stronger, and stronger muscles make your body healthier. Your heart is a muscle and must be kept healthy.</p>
<p style="textAlign: center; font-size: 1.1em">The Full Body Workout is for every muscle group in the body. It combines upper body exercises, lower body exercises, and core exercises.</p>
